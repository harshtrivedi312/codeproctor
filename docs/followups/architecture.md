# Architecture follow-ups

Non-blocking review findings. Only blockers stop a merge.

## ARC-02 part 1 (PR #6, code-reviewer verdict: MERGE, no code blockers)

### Should-fix
1. `packages/shared/src/events.ts` CODE_SIMILARITY: require exactly one of `matchedSessionId` / `aiReferenceSolutionId` (FR-803, ADR 0005 AI-1), with a test.
2. SPEECH_DETECTED and MULTIPLE_VOICES are listed as server-writable, but no doc supports a server-side audio re-check. Back with an FR/ADR reference or drop from `SERVER_EVENT_TYPES`.
3. `keystroke.ts`: RESET text counts toward the per-batch text cap, so a large RESET plus an insert is rejected. Exclude RESET from the cap, or state in ADR 0010 that the SDK starts a new batch after a large RESET; add a test (TC-062).
4. Test names missing FR/TC IDs: `events.test.ts` (3 tests), `keystroke.test.ts` (2), `permissions.test.ts` (1). `events.test.ts` misuses TC-065 (HMAC mismatch); use FR-801 or NFR-04.
5. SUPER_ADMIN currently holds review, verdict and live pause/message permissions. Record the question in ADR 0010 for BE-03; FR-904 requires appeals go to a different reviewer.
6. ADR 0010 is Proposed; the human must accept it.

### Nits
- Unknown keys are stripped, so stored events differ from the signed raw body; document in the ADR or use strict objects.
- `EXTENSION_INTERFERENCE.signal` should be an enum; treat `deviceLabel` as untrusted text in the review UI.
- `hasPermission`: the `granted !== undefined` check is unreachable; accept a `string` principal or drop it.
- List missing permissions (candidate heartbeat FR-609, appeals FR-904, reports, webhooks) in ADR "Leaves to".
- ADR 0010 §3: replay orders keystroke batches by `seq`, not arrival (NFR-08).
- `matchedSessionId` may point to an erased session; review UI must handle 404.
- Missing tests: SHORTCUT_BLOCKED regex, evidence key with leading `/` or `//`, DETECTOR_UNAVAILABLE payload, client-sent `sessionId` stripped.

### Open for ARC-02 remainder / ARC-03
`sessions.device_info.capabilities` shape, API paths (fsd.md §4 vs placeholder OpenAPI), HMAC transport and canonical JSON, evidence key layout, signing of pre-start events (MULTI_MONITOR during system check).

## frontend/step-1 architect review of shared contracts (moved from docs/followups.md)

Verdict: approve after the blocker fixes below. Fixed on this branch: `RunRequest.code` and `DraftRequest.code` now carry `maxLength: 100000` in `apps/web/openapi/openapi.yaml`, matching the new `MAX_SOURCE_CODE_LENGTH` in `packages/shared/src/code-run.ts`; `loginRequestSchema` now caps email at 254 and password at 1024 characters (`MAX_EMAIL_LENGTH`, `MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH`) so an anonymous caller cannot send an unbounded string to Argon2id (FR-101, NFR-04). Tests added in `apps/web/src/lib/forms.test.ts`. The items below are for ARC-02 (shared + API contract v0) and do not block this merge.

- **[ARC-02] Placeholder paths disagree with fsd.md §4.** The YAML uses `/v1/...` with server `http://localhost:4000`; fsd.md §4 says `/api/v1`. Run is `/candidate/questions/{id}/run` in the YAML but `/candidate/answers/:questionId/run` in fsd.md. `GET /candidate/session`, `PUT .../draft`, `GET /time` and `POST /candidate/sections/{id}/finish` are not in the fsd.md table, although ADR 0002 S-1/S-5 needs section finish and draft calls. ARC-02 must decide the final paths and add the missing rows to fsd.md §4 (or /docs/api-contract.md per ADR 0001 C-8); FE-01 then renames the mocks. Safe now only because the file is labelled placeholder and nothing on the backend reads it.
- **[ARC-02] Language list exists twice.** `codeLanguageSchema` (shared) and `components.schemas.Language` (YAML) both list python, javascript, java. ADR 0005 also names `AI_REFERENCE_LANGUAGES` with the same values. Make one shared constant the source (for example `CODE_LANGUAGES`, with `AI_REFERENCE_LANGUAGES` derived or equal), and either generate the YAML enum from it or add a parity test that loads the YAML and compares. Once NestJS publishes its code-first spec this disappears. *Partly done (ADR 0010):* `CODE_LANGUAGES` is now the single shared list and `codeLanguageSchema` and `AI_REFERENCE_LANGUAGES` derive from it; the YAML parity check is still open (FE-01 or the rest of ARC-02).
- **[ARC-02] `MAX_SOURCE_CODE_LENGTH = 100_000` is a new limit not yet in any doc.** Record it (with the submit and draft bodies, and `session_questions.final_code`) in the API contract, and note that zod `.max` counts UTF-16 code units while OpenAPI `maxLength` counts characters; non-BMP characters make the two differ slightly. The backend must also set a JSON body size limit consistent with it.
- **[ARC-02] `DraftRequest` has no shared zod schema** and is not a discriminated union: `kind: code` does not require `language`/`code`, `kind: mcq` does not require `selectedOptionId`. ADR 0007 makes `answer_spec` a discriminated union by question type; the draft and answer bodies should follow it (and cover short-answer, which the `kind` enum omits).
- **[ARC-02] `RunResult.outcome` is narrower than Judge0.** Missing at least memory-limit-exceeded and an internal/system error value (FR-503, TC-042..TC-044). Add them before BE wires Judge0, and move `RunResult` into packages/shared as zod.
- **[ARC-02] 429 shape.** The rate-limit response carries `retryAfterSeconds` in the body only; also send the standard `Retry-After` header and define one shared error envelope for 4xx (409 for out-of-section calls per ADR 0002 S-5 is not described).
- **[ARC-02] No security schemes in the YAML.** Candidate routes use the session token and staff routes the access token (ADR 0003); declare both so the generated client and docs show which routes need which.
- **[BE-02] `otpCodeSchema` is six digits only.** `/auth/2fa/verify` must also accept a recovery code (ADR 0003 §1), so BE-02 needs a separate `recoveryCodeSchema` or a union; do not reuse `otpCodeSchema` as the whole 2FA body.
- **[BE-02] Password reset schema must use `MAX_PASSWORD_LENGTH`** as its upper bound so a password that can be set can always be used to log in.
- **Nit:** `z.string().email()` is deprecated in zod 4 in favour of `z.email()`; switch when the auth schemas grow.
- **Nit:** `pnpm --filter @codeproctor/web gen:api` writes unformatted output while the committed `schema.d.ts` is prettier-formatted (and the file is in `.prettierignore`), so every regeneration shows a whole-file diff. Either append a prettier step to `gen:api` or commit the raw output.
- **Nit:** `packages/shared` resolves to `dist/` for `tsc` but to `src/` for vitest; a new export can pass tests and fail typecheck until `shared` is rebuilt. Consider `exports` with a source condition or TS project references in ARC-02.
